        "Analyzing the positive and negative reviews of a customers/guests related to a restaurant (or any other service) could help to estimate the success and popularity of the restaurant, estimate its future profits or highlight the areas that need to be changed in order to accommodate to the needs and expectations of the customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatically categorizing these reviews as positive or negative, without the need to read and interpret them one-by-one (nearly impossible for millions of reviews), could improve the efficiency of such review system, by speeding up the process of evaluating the customer feedback and adjusting the provided services.\n",

        "The dataset consists of a file containing 2 columns, one with the actual customer reviews and the second, a label indicating whether the customer has liked the food offered by the restaurant or not.\n",
        "\n",

        "Decide if a given review is positive or negative."
